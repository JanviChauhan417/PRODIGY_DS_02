# PRODIGY_DS_02
🚢 Titanic Survival Analysis using Python
This project analyzes passenger data from the Titanic dataset to explore the factors that influenced survival. Using Python and popular data science libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, this project visualizes relationships between survival and features such as:

Gender
Passenger class
Title (Mr, Mrs, Miss, etc.)
Age distribution
Fare
Family relationships (SibSp, Parch)

📊 Key Visualizations
Survival Count: Overall survival distribution
Survival by Sex: Gender impact on survival
Survival by Passenger Class: Influence of travel class
Survival by Title: How social titles affected chances
Age Distribution: General age breakdown of passengers
Age vs Survival: Comparing age groups and survival likelihood
Correlation Matrix: Statistical correlations between features

🔍 Goals
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
Understand which features had the strongest impact on survival
Practice data visualization and pattern recognition

📦 Tools & Libraries
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
numpy
